# Exploring Image Classification and GANs with Keras

In this notebook I'll be creating image classification models with images found in Zalando's articles which can be found posted on Kaggle.

The images are 28x28 pixel grayscale images- similar to the MNIST hand-written dataset. I'll be creating several neural nets to see which are the most effective in this context.

After the classification models, I'll explore generative models (GANs) to see if we're able to generate new images that our models haven't seen.

This is the repository for my capstone for General Assembly. The goal of this project is to create an image classifier for different categories of clothes. <br/><br/>

**Please note I had some difficulties setting up random seeds with keras thus some of the report writeup may not match the models exactly.
