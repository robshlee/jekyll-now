I’m a Continuous Improvement professional located in NJ working at Amazon.com. I drive continuous improvement projects and benchmark Amazon’s fulfillment centers across the NA network. 

I received a B.Sc in Industrial Engineering at NJIT where I learned about continuous improvement and manufacturing engineering. Being interested in data, my first job out of undergrad was as a business analyst for SPS Commerce, a cloud supply chain solutions company in New Jersey. Wanting to exercise my industrial engineering knowledge, I later joined Amazon.com as a frontline operations manager in California. Since then I’ve been working as a process engineer overlooking continuous improvement projects on both a local and network level. 

With my passion for data and desire to do deeper analysis past what SQL and excel could allow me to do, I attended a 12-week data science program at General Assembly in NYC. The program was designed to tackle real world projects by implementing statistical and machine learning models in Python. This blog was created for me to continue to learn and share any new data science knowledge I acquire over time.
